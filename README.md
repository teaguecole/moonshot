[Moonshot](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/39) is an informative application that lets you learn about the different apollo missions and the astronauts invovled. It introduces concepts like LazyVGrid, and makes use of NavigationLinks.  It's the first app in this series where there are multiple views that drill in to getting more details.  It'a also the first application where we are reading incoming JSON and decoding it.
